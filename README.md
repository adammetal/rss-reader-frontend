# Custom card feature

As a user i can add custom cards with custom title and description, and i can set the url to my personal feeds.

- User can extend the sources with custom source
- Watch the url what user types add as a postfix to our backend main route for example: user types: http://skynews.rss has to be "converted" to http://localhost:8080?feedUrl=http://skynews.rss
